# Kawai_san
This is a windows based virtual assistant. 

Objective :
The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for desktop. KaWai draws its
inspiration from virtual assistants like google assistant for android, and Siri for iOS. It  has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of  tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant either through voice commands or using keyboard input.
As a personal assistant, Kawai assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like  general human conversation, searching queries in google, bing or yahoo, searching for videos, sending massages, retrieving images, live weather
conditions, word meanings, and reminding the user  about the scheduled events and task.

Problem Statement :
Artificial Intelligence personal assistants have become plentiful over the  last few years. Applications such as Siri, Bixby, Ok Google and Cortana  make mobile device users’ daily routines that much easier. You may be  asking yourself how these functions. Well, the assistants receive external  data (such as movement, voice, light, GPS readings, visually defined markers, etc.) via the hardware’s sensors for further processing - and take  it from there to function accordingly.
Not too long ago, building an AI assistant was a small component of  developers’ capacities; however, nowadays, it is quite a realistic objective  even for novice programmers. To create a simple personal AI assistant,  one simply needs dedicated software and around an hour of working time.  It would take much  more time, though, to create something more  advanced and conceptually innovative. Nonetheless, well thought-out  concepts can result in a great base for a profitable startup.

Future Scope :
Virtual assistants are now available and are quick and responsive, but  there is still a long way to go. The current systems' understanding and  reliability need to be greatly enhanced. In crucial situations, the helpers  available now are still unreliable. Virtual assistants will be merged with  Artificial Intelligence, such as Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and  IoT, in the future of these assistants. We will be able to reach new  heights by incorporating these technology. What virtual assistants can  accomplish is far beyond what we have accomplished thus far. Although  Jarvis, a voice-activated virtual assistant created by Iron Man, is  fictional, it has set new expectations for what we can achieve with voice- activated virtual assistants.

Conclusion :
we discussed a Python-based Voice Activated Personal Assistant. This assistant currently works online and performs basic tasks such as weather updates, videos streaming, Wikipedia searches, opening  desktop applications, and so on. Machine  learning will be incorporated into the system in future  updates of this assistant, resulting in better  suggestions  with IoT to control nearby devices, similar to what Amazon's Alexa does.!
